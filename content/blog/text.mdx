One of the most common pieces of advice for writing maintainable code is to "Keep code DRY", or more explicitly, "Don't Repeat Yourself".

One way to do this in JavaScript is to take repeating code and capture it in functions or variables. These variables and functions can be reused, composed and combined in different ways to create new functionality.

In TypeScript, we can apply this same principle to types.

## When Deriving Makes Sense

Deriving makes most sense when the code you're coupling shares a common concern. The examples in this chapter are good examples of this. Our \`as const\` object, for instance:

Again, these concerns are closely related. Decoupling them would make our code harder to maintain and introduce more busywork into our codebase.

The decision to derive or decouple is all about reducing your future workload.

Are the two types so related that updates to one will need to ripple to the other? Derive.

Are they so unrelated that coupling them could result in more work down the line? Decouple.
